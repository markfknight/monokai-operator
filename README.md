The theme is best used with a cursive italic font such as the [Operator Mono](https://www.typography.com/blog/introducing-operator) or [Dank Mono](https://dank.sh) fonts. Install the font then add the following to your user settings to set the font (replace font name as appropriate).

```
    "editor.fontFamily": "Operator Mono",
```

or

```
    "editor.fontFamily": "Dank Mono",
```

If you wish to use Dank Monos' ligatures, add the following to your user settings.

```
    "editor.fontLigatures": true,
```
